# README: Facial Recognition Attendance System with Analytic Dashboard

## Overview:
This README provides an overview of the Facial Recognition Attendance System with an Analytic Dashboard. The system utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms developed primarily using Python programming language. It incorporates CNN algorithm for facial object detection and Dlib face landmark detection algorithm for recognizing different individuals. Visual Studio Code is used for development including algorithm implementation, design, and backend. The system integrates with a website interface using HTML and CSS. Additionally, the system includes common attendance system functions and an analytic dashboard. 

## Testing:
After completing the artificial intelligence algorithms, the system is tested to accurately detect faces from real-time video streams and recognize individuals. Performance evaluation is based on accuracy and error rates. Loss functions, including classification and regression losses, are recorded and displayed in a graph for improvement insights. These loss functions measure the error between predicted and actual values guiding model training.

## Implementation:
The system requires employees to provide 50 images for attendance registration. Admin registers employees by uploading these images. Once registered, the system captures employee attendance upon entry. Attendance records are organized and presented through a dashboard for analysis. Admins can modify employee information, create new admin accounts, and update their own personal information.

## Deployment:
System deployment includes offering a trial to users and soliciting feedback for enhancement of upcoming software environment.

## Project Requirements:
The system development requires hardware, software, and other requirements. 

### Software Requirements:
- Visual Studio Code: Main software for algorithm development and backend.
- MySQL: Database handling.
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Dlib, OpenCV, Flask for face detection, recognition, and web interface.

### Hardware Requirements:
- Camera: Required for face detection and recognition.

## Conclusion:
This README outlines the facial recognition attendance system with an analytic dashboard, detailing its development, testing, implementation, and deployment phases. The system utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to provide accurate attendance tracking and analysis for businesses.
